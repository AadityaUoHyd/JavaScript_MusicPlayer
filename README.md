# JavaScript_MusicPlayer

- Created a demo music player with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- The background image of media player will rotate once you click to start listening song, & it'll pause when you'll pause music.
- The song title and artist name will appear, and so is which number of track one is listening to.
- The background image of each track, along with whole background will be changed in each song.
- One can lower or increase volume according to their need.
- Images & music are taken from free open source from FreePic and FreeMusicArchive, no IPR issues. Loaded from their CDN URLs, no need to store.
  One can store those in DB as well rather hard-coding. For demo purpose, I'd taken only four songs.
